# JGLPipeline

JGLPipeline is a simple OpenGL Java wrapper.

JGLPipeline is built on LWJGL 3 and requires OpenGL 2.1 or greater. Immediate mode is not used in favor of more modern practices.

## Status

I'm currently new to Git and build systems, so nothing is stable. The API may change, I'll probably refactor package names (i.e, shivshank to standard package name), and I may switch build systems.

Flexibility may also vary. I haven't yet touched frame buffers and many OpenGL 3+ features, so the architecture might not be built to support them (for now).
